== About
This project is entirely work in progress at the moment.

== Compiling
* Arch Linux (also supports WSL2):
. `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
. `source ~/.bashrc`
. `sudo pacman -Syu`
. `sudo pacman -S base-devel gdb clang ninja mold`

== Unsorted
If you forgot to set a password during the installation, use *CHANGEME* as the password; it's strongly recommended to change this with `sudo passwd`.
