== About
This project is entirely work in progress at the moment.

== Compiling
* Arch Linux (also supports WSL2):
. `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
. `source ~/.bashrc`
. `sudo pacman -Syu`
. `sudo pacman -S base-devel gdb clang ninja mold`

== Usage

. Run `disk_format`
. Run `bootstrap`
. The chroot has to manually be entered into before running `post_chroot`; running `post_chroot` via arch-chroot causes severe problems: `arch-chroot /mnt /bin/zsh`
. Run `post_chroot`

== Unsorted
If you forgot to set a password during the installation, use *CHANGEME* as the password; it's strongly recommended to change this with `sudo passwd`.
